# 309projectSpring18
Soccer game for iOS made with my teammates for Computer Science 309 at Iowa State. 

Collaborators were:
- Myself, Ryan Toepfer (iOS app, game service)
- Nolan Kim (game service)
- Diego Realpe (crud service)
- Mark Schwartz (iOS app)


Running the app
what you need:
- XCode and a Mac
- a server and GO
- a Sql database (works with mysql by default)

Switching to 4 player mode:
- use app from branch fourPlayerApp
- on gameservice set constant NUMPLAYERS in gameservice.go to 4
